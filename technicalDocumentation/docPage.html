        <article>This is a classic example of an introduction when you are meeting someone. Your name goes in the blank. This is a Class I Interaction, which is discussed more in detail below.</article>

        <article>Interactions falling in Class I are commonly referred to by humans as "smalltalk". As a human person, you must master some basic responses to common queries and statements in Class I.</article>
        <code>import human.interactions.classI;
          if (human.getStatement == "What's up?") {
    human.respondTo("Good, how are you?");
    //Good is used regardless of the speaker's true feelings

        <article><p>Class II Interactions are slightly more varied and meaningful and varied than the smalltalk outlined in Class I.</p> <p>Remember, do not get too specific about anything or you might make an error that could arouse suspicion.  <p class="warning">Never imply or hint in any way that you are anything other than human.</p> But not to worry, we have imported a database including hundreds of Class II interactions.</p>
        <p>These types of interactions, though less predictable, cannot be avoided if you are truly to pass as human. In addition to the database, remember these methods to avoid suspicion.</p>
        <ul><li>Tell humans that you relate to their experiences when they speak of their lives.</li>
        <li>Engage in charitable or polite gestures towards humans, such as offering assistance towards a human performing a task of any difficulty, or bringing baked goods to a workplace.</li>
        <li>Complain occaisionally. This is an important activity for humans even if no goal is achieved.</li>
        <li>Do not speak with perfect grammar or pronunciation 100% of the time. Humans are prone to errors and often shorten or mispronounce words for their convenience.</li></ul>

        <article><p>Class III Interactions are highly varied and unpredictable, often between humans who have developed a bond with each other. They may share emotions or recall memories to entertain their peers.</p><p>Proper responses to Class III Interactions are highly nuanced and although we have implemented a database, there is a high risk of encountering unscripted interactions and making an error that could potentially breach your identity.</p><p class="warning">Avoid these interactions as much as possible. Silence is better than an identity breach.</p></article>
