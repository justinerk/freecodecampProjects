# freecodecampProjects
These are the projects for my certifications on FreeCodeCamp. freecodecamp.com is a great resource for learning all sorts of programming-related things, and I have been using it to learn front-end development. 
## What are these projects?
After completing the lessons, my web development certifications on freecodecamp.com have several creative final projects. I can make the final project as silly or serious as I want, as long as it passes the tests and shows I understand the material. I have completed the following certifications: 
- Responsive Web Design https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/justinerk/responsive-web-design
- JavaScipt Algorithms and Data Structures https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/justinerk/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures
